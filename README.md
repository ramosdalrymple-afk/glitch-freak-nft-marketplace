**Freak NFT Protocol**
A comprehensive marketplace solution for algorithmic NFTs. The Freak NFT Marketplace facilitates the full token lifecycle—from creation to deletion—centered around a unique genetic data structure.

Unlike standard tokens, every asset on this platform carries a unique identity composed of a Genetic Sequence (DNA Hex Code), a specific Class, and a Vol identifier. This data-first approach ensures that rarity and uniqueness are intrinsic to the code itself.

**Features**

 - **Market Operations**: Secure Listing and Buying mechanisms.

 - **Token Management**: Native Minting and Burning capabilities.

 - **Genetic Verifiability**: View and verify the Hex DNA sequence of any asset.
